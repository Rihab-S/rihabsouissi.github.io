            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>I specialize in developing and optimizing machine learning models by preprocessing data, engineering relevant features, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy and efficiency. My expertise includes decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting methods (such as XGBoost and LightGBM), and deep learning architectures. I leverage optimization techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble learning to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.</p>
