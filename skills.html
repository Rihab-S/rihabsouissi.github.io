            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>I specialize in developing and optimizing machine learning models by preprocessing data, engineering relevant features, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy and efficiency. My expertise includes decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting methods (such as XGBoost and LightGBM), and deep learning architectures. I leverage optimization techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble learning to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.</p>

            <h2>C++</h2>
            <p>I have used C++ to develop real-world simulations for sensor networks, focusing on optimizing performance, data transfer, and accuracy. Using advanced C++ features such as multi-threading and memory management, I created scalable models that simulated real-time sensor interactions. This experience strengthened my understanding of distributed systems and the challenges of deploying efficient and reliable sensor networks.</p>
